Most of the test for the AP Computer Science Principles exam is just coding logic. This means things like using variables, understanding how to use loops, going through lists, etc. These problems can be seen with basic pseudocode or with a triangle where you have to get it to it's correct location. 

First the pseudocode. The pseudocode is basically basic code. Try to think about about some basic coding language, like Python (or whatever you are familiar with). Try to connect that pseudocode with that code you know and understand what that pseudocode does in that coding language. 

For example, let's say I have this basic python code:

```Python
i = 10

if i == 1 {
  print("Hello!")
} else {
  print("Bye!")
}
```

Now in pseudocode, they will just give you some basic statements. They will first announce that some variable is some value. Then they will have little blocks within each other that basically corresponds to the same if statement I wrote before. The only thing different is the way they put it out. 

This section is really easy because you can just translate it with some code that you already know. 

Two things you need to watch out for: Lists & Random

In this pseudocode, they do something a little different with these 2 functions. They are not too different from other coding languages, but I will still say it since it confused me a little. 

For example, they give you a list: examplelist = [a, b, c, d, e]. When they ask you to do len(examplelist) make sure you just count how many terms there are. When they ask you do something like examplelist[3], just look for the 3rd item in the list. 

This is a little different from other coding languages like python for example, since python starts with 0. In python you would call examplelist[2] to get the same thing. 

Now for random. Make sure that you include both terms within random. For example: random(1,2). Include both 1 and 2. 

Those are just some little tips with coding logic and the AP Computer Science Principles exam. Hope this helped!
