Purpose: Students understand the AP CSP Exam 
Outcomes:

* Student understand the topics tested in the CSP exam 

The APCSP exam is a very simple exam to understand. There is a create task and the MC test that takes around 2 hours. 
Lets dive into each of the sections! 


A. MC test
* The MC test is 2 hours long and has 70 MC questions. 

There are 3 types of MC questions 

* Single-select questions (57 questions)
* Single-select questions based on a reading passage (5 questions)
* Multi-select questions (8 questions) MUST GET BOTH OPTIONS  CORRECT TO GET THE POINT

The topics are weighted as such: 
* Big Idea 1: Creative Development 	10–13%
* Big Idea 2: Data 	17–22%
* Big Idea 3: Algorithms and Programming 	30–35%
* Big Idea 4: Computer Systems and Networks 	11–15%
* Big Idea 5: Impact of Computing	21–26%

If you took an AP before, you are probably well aware that the AP exam in notorious for stimulus based questions. 
The CSP exam is no different. Lets look at the type of problems in more detail. 

B. Types of Problems 

a. Stimulus based
* There are MC questions where you have to anlayze a sitiuation inorder to answer the question 
* It not a question that tests memmoerization, it tests you critical thinking ability, they become easy with practice 

Example:

<p>
  
* As you can see, you had to understand the scenario to answer the question. 
  
b. Multi select 
  * This is when 2 of the options are correct 
  * You must get both correct to get the point 
  * Will be a combination of stimulus based and problems that test your CS vocab

 C. Create Task 
  * 30% of exam score 
  * You will submit a video that has a fuction being used 
  * You will also submit answers to a few questions about your code 
  * Finally you will also submit your code 
  
 This creation will be done during the 2nd trimester. Mr. M's rubric will be very similar to the rubric of the AP exam. 
 This will mean that if you follow all the direction and pay attention to the tech talks, you should be in safe hands.
  
 I will attach an annotated rubric below, if you follow the rubric, you should be able to get a 6/6. These should be easy point so aim for a 6. 
 Few pointer that are not illustrated in the rubric that you should know. 
  
 * Row 1: program purpose and fucntion: You dont have to run the whole program, just run the function. You can still get the point if the whole program has bugs. 
 * Row 2: Data abstraction: The API has to enhace the code. If your doing a project on climate change, you API can't have information about covid stats. 
 * Row 2: Data abstraction: The API has to be created by your team, can't scrape data from a website for this point. 
 * Make sure you dont leave ambiguity, hit it right out the park in your responces and your code, don't leave it to the mercy of the grader.
