After taking the first AP computer science principles practice exam, you might start to feel overwhelmed because of how much subject is in it. You probably missed too many questions are in the dark yellow or light green range. At the moment, this might seem like a horrible score and you feel like you won't be able to fix this. 

This is exactly how I felt when I took my first practice exam. Even after taking 2 more practice exams, I still felt like I didn't understand what to do. 

When you first take the AP CSP class, you will go through tons of coding work. The first few weeks and maybe months might seem super confusing because you don't understand how to code. However, once you constantly keep coding, you start to develop a coding mindset and understand the logic behind all the code. If you still don't understand, then try to read the code and understand what function it is trying to do. Most coding languages are pretty clear to understand since it is basically just english. 

Most of the questions on the AP exam are "algorithms & Programming" which is basically just doing basic code with things like strings and variables.

Even though I had years of experience with code and understanding logic behind code, I constantly missed multiple questions. The reason for this is not because of you. It's Collegeboard's requirements. Collegeboard does some things a little different from regular coding languages like Python. It relies on pseudo code.

In addition to these questions, there will be multiple questions that you won't really understand at first like collaboration and creative development. For these questions you might just use common sense and get the questions right. 

Now the way to solve all these problems and make sure you get a super high score is simple. Just get a book. I recommend the Barron's CSP book. In this book just go through the diagnostic test, figure out what you need the most help on, and thoroughly read through that section. You could probably even skim through because most of the things that CSP tests is pretty much common sense once you get used to code. 

After that, try to memorize some of the weird things like packet loss and things like that.

Pretty much every question on that test will be straight memorization or super basic logic where you can use common sense. These books will just make sure you understand what Collegeboard is looking for which will help you ace the CSP exam.

If you are not able to purchase this book, then also check out Khan Academy. Khan Academy basically does the same things except more interactive. I personally like the books more which is why I bought this book.

In the end, don't stress about the CSP exam. It'll be a breeze. Just make sure you do code in class everyday and start to understand code. Everything will come naturally to you from there. Then just read the book or go through khan academy to make sure you understand what Collegeboard wants from you. Then you take the test and ACE it!
