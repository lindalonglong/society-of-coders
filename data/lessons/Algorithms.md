An operator is a symbol that carries out mathematical computation.

| Arithmetic operator | Description | Example |
| ------------- | ----------- | 
| + | Addition | 1 + 2 = 3 |
| - | Subtraction | 5 - 5 = 0 |
| * | Multiplication | 3 * 2 = 6 |
| / | Division | 4 / 2 = 2 |
| % | Modules |

Note:
* Modulus is the remainder of a division.
  - Example: 14 MOD 5 = 4 because the remainder is 4.
* The order of operations that should be performed:
  - Parentheses
  - Modules
  - Multiplication & Division
  - Addition & Subtraction

| Comparison operator | Description | Example |
| ------------- | ----------- | 
| = | Equal | 1 = 1 |
| != | Not equal | 2 != 1 |
| < | Multiplication | 3 < 6 |
| > | Division | 6 > 3 |
