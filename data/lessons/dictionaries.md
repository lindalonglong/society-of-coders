**What does a dictionary do?**
-A dictionary similar to a list, and it stores data in key-value pairs. Every pair maps each key to its associated value.
-Dictionaries are best used when storing non-similar data that relate to the same topic, or when key pairs will be useful
```
Ex: foods = {
“Fruit”:”apple”,
“Vegetable”:”carrot”
}
```
**What makes up a dictionary?**
- Assigned to a variable
- Notated by curly brackets
- Keys and values make a pair, each key and value contained in quotes and separated by a colon
- Pairs are separated by commas
```
exampledict = {
“month”: “May”,
“brand”: “Microsoft”,
“age”: “17”
}
```
